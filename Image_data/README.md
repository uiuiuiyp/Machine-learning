## Image data

These are examples of machine learning algorithms that process image data

- __CIFAR-10__ algorithm builds a neural network from scratch using just tensorflow (low level approach)

- __Fashion MNIST__ algorithm builds a simple neural network from scratch using keras module within tensorflow (medium level approach)

- __Monkeys__ algorithm trains fully-connected layers on top of Xception module (a pre-trained convolution neural network) to do image recognition of monkey species (very high level approach, cannot change internal neural network)
