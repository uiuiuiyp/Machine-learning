## Image data

These are examples of machine learning algorithms that process image data

- __Fashion MNIST__ algorithm builds a simple neural network from scratch to do image recognition of clothing type

- __Monkeys__ algorithm trains fully-connected layers on top of Xception module (a pre-trained convolution neural network) to do image recognition of monkey species.
