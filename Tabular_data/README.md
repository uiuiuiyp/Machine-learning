## Tabular data

These are examples of machine learning algorithms that process tabular data (numeric and categorical).

- __Poverty__ algorithm combines information within a single tabular data file to generate features

- __Home Credit__ algorithm combines information from multiple tabular data files that arranged like a relational, SQL-like database. 

- __Forest cover__ algorithm uses ensemble methods to first fit the data using multiple algorithms (LightGBM, ExtraTrees, RandomForest) and uses XGBoost to fit the outcome of the first stage to predict the final results.
