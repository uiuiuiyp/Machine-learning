The input data files can be downloaded from the linked to the Kaggle website. 

 - The goal of the project is to predict the wine review score based on the wine review descriptions whose length range from 50-550 characters.

- We use term frequency- inverse documentary frequency to generate features and use weighted-linear regression to fit the model. 

- Some examples of the "positive" indicator words which predict higher review scores are: 'rich', 'complex', 'delicious', whereas the "negative" indicator words are: 'simple', bitter', 'green'.
